## Setup Instructions

### 1. Local Development

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. The app will work in test mode with mock data

### 2. Telegram Bot Integration

1. Create a Telegram bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Set up your bot's Web App URL
3. Update the bot username in `script.js` (line 365)
4. Deploy to a web server with HTTPS

### 3. Ad Integration

The app uses LibTL SDK for ads. To configure:

1. Replace the LibTL script tag in `index.html` with your zone
2. Update the ad function calls in `script.js`
3. Test ad functionality in production environment

## Customization

### Theme Colors

The app automatically adapts to Telegram's theme, but you can customize fallback colors in `style.css`:

```css
:root {
  --tg-theme-bg-color: #ffffff;
  --tg-theme-text-color: #000000;
  --tg-theme-button-color: #0088cc;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Ad Rewards

Modify reward amounts in `script.js`:

```javascript
// In showRewardedInterstitial()
const reward = 5.00;  // Change reward amount
const points = 100;   // Change points amount
```

### API Integration

Replace mock data with real API calls:

```javascript
// Replace loadAppData() with real API calls
async function loadAppData() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user-data');
  appData = await response.json();
  updateUI();
}
```
